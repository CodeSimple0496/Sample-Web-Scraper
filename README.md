# Sample-Web-Scraper

This project is a simple Python-based web scraper that automatically extracts data from websites. It uses the Requests library to send HTTP requests and BeautifulSoup to parse and extract useful information from the HTML content.

The scraper can be customized to collect things like product details, headlines, job listings, or any structured web data. It includes error handling, logging, and rate limiting (to avoid getting blocked). The extracted data can be saved in formats like CSV or JSON for further analysis.
